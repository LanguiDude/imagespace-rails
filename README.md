We built this code using Cloud9, and that is how we are familiar setting it up and executing it.

Step 1: Log in to cloud9, and create a workspace using the fork url from github.

Step 2: Click "Start Editing"

Step 3: $ gem install rails -v 4.2.0.beta4

Step 4: $ bundle install

Step 5: $ rails s -b $IP -p $PORT

Step 6: click "share" at the top of the screen, and click whatever is listed in the 
        "Application" text box, and click "Open" when it appears.

Step 7: You are at our home page! Congratulations!
